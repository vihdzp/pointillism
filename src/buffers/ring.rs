//! Implements ring or cyclic buffers.
//!
//! These are meant to be used when you continually need to store the last few samples output from
//! some signal, such as for a delay effect.
//!
//! ## Kinds of ring buffers
//!
//! We implement two kinds of ring buffers:
//!
//! - [`Shift`] buffers push new data and the start, and shift all pre-existing data by one entry.
//!   These are fast when they are very small (â‰¤ 4), but are entirely impractical for larger
//!   buffers.
//! - [`Circ`] buffers write data into consecutive positions of a buffer, then loop around when they
//!   reach the end. The branching incurs some small overhead, but this is well worth it for large
//!   buffers.
//!
//! ## Todo
//!
//! Actually test that [`Shift`] buffers are more efficient!

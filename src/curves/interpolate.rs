/// A trait for a buffer, which is used in order to apply some interpolation algorithm.
///
/// By interpolation, we mean a process of creating new [`Samples`](Sample) between two others. We
/// refer to the first of these samples as the "current" sample, and the second as the "next"
/// sample.
///
/// Interpolation is particularly relevant for time [`Stretching`](Stretch).
///
/// ## Implementing the trait
///
/// The current design doesn't really lend itself to generality, unless you want to implement more
/// "experimental" interpolation methods that work with small buffers. As such, we don't recommend
/// implementing this trait for custom types. See also the to-do section below.
///
/// ## Todo
///
/// Having a rolling window probably works well enough for the sample sizes we currently use. For
/// anything larger, it might be more computationally efficient to make larger buffers. That way, we
/// can write from the signal "in one go", instead of having to constantly read values and shift
/// them.

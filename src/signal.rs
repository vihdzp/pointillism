//! Declares the most basic traits concerning [`Signals`](Signal).
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! The following example is a simplified implementation of [`NoiseGen`](crate::prelude::NoiseGen).
//!
//! ```
//! # use pointillism::prelude::*;
//! /// A signal that produces random envelope data.
//! struct NoiseGen {
//!     /// The current random value.
//!     current: Env,
//! }
//!
//! impl Signal for NoiseGen {
//!     // This signal produces envelope data.
//!     type Sample = Env;
//!
//!     // Returns the current value.
//!     fn get(&self) -> Env {
//!         self.current
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! impl SignalMut for NoiseGen {
//!     // Updates the current value.
//!     fn advance(&mut self) {
//!         self.current = Env::rand();
//!     }
//!     
//!     // Retriggering a random signal amounts to choosing a new random value.
//!     fn retrigger(&mut self) {         
//!         self.current = Env::rand();
//!     }
//! }
//! ```

use crate::{freq::Freq, sample::Sample};

/// A trait for a stream of data [`Samples`](Sample), generated every frame.
///
/// This data can either be audio data, meaning [`Mono`](crate::sample::Mono) or
/// [`Stereo`](crate::sample::Stereo), or envelope data [`Env`](crate::sample::Env).
///
/// Most signals will implement the stronger trait [`SignalMut`], meaning that the state of the
/// signal can be advanced. The main use case for this weaker trait is signal routing. For instance,
/// you can create two references to a [`SignalMut`] via [`Ref`](crate::prelude::Ref), and apply
/// separate effects to them.
///
/// ## Implementing the trait
///
/// In order to implement this trait on your custom type, you only need to define one method:
///
/// - [`get`](Signal::get): Gets the next sample from the signal.
///
/// See the [module docs](self) for an example implementation.
pub trait Signal {
    /// The type of sample generated by the signal.
    type Sample: Sample;

    /// Gets the next sample from the signal.
    ///
    /// This should return the same result when called repeatedly, as long as the signal isn't
    /// modified, and `advance` or `retrigger` is not called.
    fn get(&self) -> Self::Sample;
}

/// A trait for a stream of data [`Samples`](Sample), generated every frame.
///
/// This data can either be audio data, meaning [`Mono`](crate::sample::Mono) or
/// [`Stereo`](crate::sample::Stereo), or envelope data [`Env`](crate::sample::Env).
///
/// This trait is stronger than the [`Signal`] trait, as it also allows the signal to be advanced by
/// a frame.
///
/// ## Implementing the trait
///
/// In order to implement this trait on your custom type, you need to implement [`Sample`] together
/// with the following two methods:
///
/// - [`advance`](SignalMut::advance): Advances the state of the signal by a frame.
/// - [`retrigger`](SignalMut::retrigger): Resets the signal to its initial state.
///
/// See the [module docs](self) for an example implementation.
pub trait SignalMut: Signal {
    /// Advances the state of the signal by a frame.
    fn advance(&mut self);

    /// Resets the signal to its initial state.
    fn retrigger(&mut self);

    /// Gets the next sample and advances the state of the signal.
    fn next(&mut self) -> Self::Sample {
        let res = self.get();
        self.advance();
        res
    }
}

/// A trait for a signal with a "main" frequency that can be modified.
///
/// Not to be confused with [`Freq`].
///
/// This is implemented both for signals that have a frequency parameter such as
/// [`LoopGen`](crate::generators::LoopGen), as well as straightforward wrappers for these signals.
pub trait Frequency: SignalMut {
    /// The "main" frequency of the signal.
    fn freq(&self) -> Freq;

    /// Returns a mutable reference to the "main" frequency of the signal.
    fn freq_mut(&mut self) -> &mut Freq;
}

/// A trait for a signal with a "base" signal that can be modified. This is often a generator in a
/// chain of effects.
///
/// This is implemented both for basic signals that don't depend on others, as well as
/// straightforward wrappers of these.
pub trait Base: SignalMut {
    /// The "base" signal type.
    type Base: SignalMut;

    /// A reference to the "base" signal.
    fn base(&self) -> &Self::Base;

    /// always return zero.

/// You can think of the `stop` method as an analog to a MIDI note off event.

/// your signal.
